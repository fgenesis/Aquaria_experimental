LVPA -- Lost Vikings Project Archive

Originally written for https://github.com/fgenesis/lv3proj
- hence the name.

----------[ TL;DR ]------------
** Modify VFSDefines.h to your needs.
** For thread safety, see VFSAtomic.h/.cpp
** You are encouraged to link this library statically.

----------[ Intro ]------------
ttvfs is a small C++ library designed to provide virtual file system support
inside of an application. The application can choose to mount files and directories
from any source, and access them in a uniform way (similar to fopen(), see examples).

This does *not* mean support for fancy "http://",
"zip://", "smb://"-like filenames, neither support for accessing archives
like directories, as in "./data.zip/file.txt".

If such functionality is required, en extension has to be made that generates
a file/folder tree that can be used by the library.
This means: if you manage to generate a VFS tree from a slice of toast, it can be used.

This library is licensed under the zlib license (see below).
If you use this code and like it, feel free to send me an email to
googlemail.com with false.genesis@ prepended.
- that'd make me happy.
Patches/improvements are welcome!

----------[ Howto ]------------
This library is intended to be small and extensible,
and comes only with a minimal set of classes.
See VFSFile.h, VFSDir.h, VFSLoader.h for infos about how to write your own classes
that add functionality.

By default, this library is not thread safe - adding this would bloat it too much.
You probably have your own threading library if you care about thread safety,
if so, edit VFSAtomic.h/.cpp and add a few lines to glue this lib together
with your threading implementation of choice.
Then, edit VFSDefines.h and enable thread safety there.

------- [ Extensions ]--------

None yet.

Made an extension? Let me know, send a mail!
